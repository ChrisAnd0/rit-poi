			<p>The academic tunnels allow travel from major academic buildings without going outside. The cold winters, and in particular, cold winds of Rochester make the existence of these tunnels a godsend, even if they don't connect every building. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, the fabled tunnel connecting dorm side of campus to academic side doesn't exist.</p>

			<p>There are two literal underground tunnels connecting buildings together. One of these connects the SAU/Campus Center to the Eastman building, and the other connects The Wallace Library, Liberal Arts Building, Gleason, and Gosnell. Various other buildings are connected, but usually these buildings are connected and therefore simply share a basement.</p>

			<p>There also exists the skybridge connecting Gleason to Golisano. As a result, it is possible to get from The Wallace Library to the Innovation Center (Colloquially known as the Toilet Bowl) without going outside, even though it will take more time than walking outside.</p>

			<p>The path is as follows:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>From The Wallace Library foyer, go down the main staircase.</li>
				<li>Turn around and take the hallway behind you, leading to Liberal Arts.</li>
				<li>To the left is a double-door with "Tho College of Engineering" painted above it. Go through said doors to the tunnel system.</li>
				<li>Near the end of this hall is a door on the right to a stairwell. Go up these stairs, then the next flight of stairs to the second floor of Gleason.</li>
				<li>Continue down this hallway until you reach another stairwell going up. Go up.</li>
				<li>Cross the Golisano skybridge</li>
				<li>Turn left and go through Golisano, then take the stairwell down to the first floor.</li>
				<li>Continue down the hall to the Toilet Bowl.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>To go the other way, simply follow these directions in reverse.</p>
