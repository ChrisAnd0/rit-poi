			<p>Study areas are highly prominent around campus, providing lots of comfortable areas to study at and get work done. However, with the large number of students at RIT, many of these study areas quickly fill up. The temptation to return home and do work there is high and often the most convenient option, but its also very easy to get distracted at home. A few alternatives to the Library (which is nearly always full, therefore difficult to find seats at) include the Waterfall Lounge (basement of the Campus Center), Fireside Lounge (back area of the Campus Center), and Innovation Center main area. Additionally, most academic buildings have small lounge areas to do work at. There's usually a spot somewhere on campus to study. Additionally, free seats are usually much easier to find around 40 minutes past an hour, as it is when people start leaving for classes, but the current classes have not yet been let out.</p>
