			<p>The dorm tunnels connect all of the various dorm buildings together. This means that you can travel from your dorm room to 2 dining areas, 2 convenience stores, or your friend's place without going outside.</p>
			
			<p>The dorm tunnels are also nicely decorated with various murals made by various organizations on campus. This makes them much nicer to look at than the academic tunnels.</p>
			
			<p>There seems to often be confusion about the path to Dining Commons. This is somewhat understandable, as unlike traveling from dorm to dorm, getting to Commons isn't as straightforward.</p>

			<p class="clear">The path is as follows:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>From Sol's Underground, continue down the tunnel leading to Ellingston.</li>
				<li>Eventually, there will be a well-lit hallway to the left. A large mural by the School of Art and Animation adorns this hall. If you reach Ellingston or LBJ, you've gone too far. Turn left down this hall.</li>
				<li>Turn right at the end of this hallway. At the end of this next tunnel, turn left.</li>
				<li>To your left in this hall is a flight of stairs, and to the right an elevator. Either take the stairs up twice or the elevator to the 2nd floor. Welcome to Dining Commons!</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>To go the other way, simply follow these directions in reverse.</p>
