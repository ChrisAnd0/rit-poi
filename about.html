			<h2>About</h2>
			
			<p>This site was created for ISTE 240 Web and Mobile II, Spring 2017, Instructor Dan Bogaard.</p>
			
			<p>The page focuses on RIT as my location since my actual hometown is a very small, rather uninteresting rural area which I struggled to come up with 10 relevant locations for content to write about, and while I have traveled a lot, I do not know enough about any given location or area to feel comfortable writing about it. As a result, I decided to write about my current area of residence, being Henrietta, RIT, and the surrounding areas.</p>
			
			<p>The site satisfies the grading conditions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Design techniques: The site is very cleanly designed, with simple, clean, and relevant colors and clear lines.</li>
				<li>Information is laid out cleanly on each page.</li>
				<li>Content is relevant and (hopefully) interesting and unique.</li>
				<li>Navigation is simple and easy to get around. Sites do not go more than 2 levels deep for the sake of simplicity. Pages are well and accurately named.</li>
				<li>Pages built using HTML5 and CSS3. Semantic tags are used. Pages are positioned with various CSS rules, adjusted for media queries, and the navigation bar uses display: flex to display properly on desktop.</li>
				<li>Images used are my own.</li>
			</ul>
