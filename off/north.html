			<h2>Heading North</h2>
			
			<p>There's more to be found further away from RIT as well. North of Henrietta is Rochester itself, which is full of other areas of interest. If heading into Rochester, the RTS 24 bus serves RIT and will head into downtown Rochester. If you have your own vehicle, though, there are a few routes into Rochester.</p>
			
			<p>The shortest route is via Brighton-Henrietta Townline Road, directly off of RIT, then turning left onto West Henrietta Road. This route will take you directly towards the University of Rochester and then downtown. Despite being the shortest route, its usually the most busy, meaning its generally the longest route unless its late at night.</p>
			
			<p>Taking I-390 N into Rochester is also an option, but there doesn't happen to be an exit directly into Rochester, making this option difficult. Taking I-390 is most useful for getting to other surrounding areas (the airport, Gates, Irondequoit, Victor, or East Rochester), but not into Rochester itself.</p>
			
			<p>Generally, the fastest route into Rochester is to take Scottsville Road north into Rochester. It follows a similar route as West Henrietta Road, but is significantly less busy, leading to less traffic and less travel time.</p>
