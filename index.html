			<p>Welcome! The primary aim of this site is to inform prospective students of campus life at and around RIT, or provide intesesting tidbits to current students. There's often much to be had about the history, class structure, or co-ops at RIT, but significantly less about regular day-to-day student life. So while there's plenty out there about the Sentinel, the various dining options, and other "tour guide" markers, I'd like to focus a bit more on the objects and areas interacted with on a day-to-day basis.</p>
			
			<p>The site's aim is mostly to be helpful to prospective or new students, but even if you've been at RIT for years, I hope there's some tidbits of information you didn't know before here too.</p>
			
			<p>All photos were taken by myself unless otherwise noted.</p>
			
			<p>Use the navigation above to get started!</p>
